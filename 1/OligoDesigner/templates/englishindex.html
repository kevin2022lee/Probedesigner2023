    <div class="panel-body">
        <p><b>ProbeDesigner</b>Software base on BioPython libs, which relies on the Python language, can easily implement regular sequential reads, writes, Blast comparisons, homology analysis, and interaction with Entrez databases,
         SwissPort processing, Medline database, graphics model, genetic analysis, protein sequence prediction and other functions.</br></p>
        <p><b>QuantiMAT</b>Technology is a branch-based signal amplification technology based on the development of the second generation of domestic signal amplification technology，<b>ProbeDesigner</b>he various QuantiMAT experiments can be generated based on the sequence information of the selected target
         (ML), LE (Label Extender), BL (Blocker). These probe groups passed the severe NSH (nonspecific hybridization analysis), making the probe and universal 2.0 sequence produce the smallest NSH
         To ensure that the experimental high specificity, high sensitivity.</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <p><b>Filters</b>is a powerful tool for changing the type of probe that allows the service. Using the filter guidelines, you can increase or decrease the number of probes that can be used to detect CES or LES. </p>
        <p>It should be noted that the main reason for changing the filtering criteria is to increase the number of CES and LES that can be used to detect. While the default thresholds are excellent guidelines, they are. In many cases, you may have probes that are slightly above or below the allowed threshold.</p>
        <p>You, as a probesets designer (I bet you never call), will need to examine the probe in each probe group to determine if any of the features can be easily but does not affect the detection performance.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that the "filter" action (ie, relax the filter standard) relaxes all the probes in the tree. You can not relax the filter for a single probe. When you relax the filter for a probe, you can change the state of the other probes in an advantageous way.</p>

        <b><em>CE-LE interaction</em>declare</b>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p><b>CE-LE interaction</b> known by the ProbeDesigner software is the ultimate source of the background, in fact, these interactions are used to establish the final distribution of the probes in the analysis. Complementary CES and LEs may interact through the following mechanisms. This can be prevented from the service by excluding the same service from one or two probes in the probe group. The method of calculating the probe, calculating the ce-le interaction, and reassigning is necessary, you can imagine an iterative process. Use the assignment view to enable this procedure.</p>
        <p>The CE-LE and NSH-calculated ce-le interactions were evaluated using the X-mer algorithm. PD searches for all possible extension primers in the form of x-mer (CEs vs. LEs), estimates their stability, and they are. The same combination of calculations, it will be a heavy X-mer results of the estimated ce-le cross on the background. All ce-le interactions give a weight 6 similar to the le-amp cross-reaction for system 1 detection.</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>ProbeDesigner which the core of the software is the x-mer algorithm. The algorithm is used to assess the hybridization stability between any universal sequence </p>
        <p>"X-mer" refers to the length of the perfect perfect hybrid determined by the algorithm. Although the default value of the program is a 4-mer, you can adjust this parameter.
         When the algorithm: The x-mer algorithm begins to identify all possible x-mers between the selected probe and the generic sequence, a simple weighting scheme is used to predict every perfect
         X-mer mixed stability, and summarizes the cross-reactivity of each probe with the universal sequence for all hybridization results. The following example:</p>
    <p>1. All possible 4-mers are defined as follows:</p>
    <p><img class="img" src="http://kkds1314-img2.stor.sinaapp.com/MjAxNjEyMjMxNjAxNTY2MTgyNTZfMj.png" /></p>
    <p>There are two 4-mers: TTTC-GAAA and TTCG-CGAA</p>
    <p>2. Any x-mer (with a typical 4-mers as an example) is calculated by passing a simple weighting scheme.</p>
    <p><img class="img" src="http://kkds1314-img2.stor.sinaapp.com/MjAxNjEyMjMxNjAzMzAwMzUyOTVfMj.png" /></p>
    <p>And 3. all of the 4-mers calculated fractional multi-universal probe sequences and design probes cross-reactive factor values
</p>
    <p><img class="img" src="http://kkds1314-img2.stor.sinaapp.com/MjAxNjEyMjMxNjA0MTAxMzcyODFfMj.png" /></p>
    <P>Once the x-mer algorithm produces the result of the cross-reactivity of all possible general sequences, the NSH algorithm calls.</p>
    <p>1. Each x-mer score is multiplied by the corresponding weighting factor (1X CE with AP, 6X CE amplifier leading, 15 times CE and arm) to determine the NSH score of the probe. There is a result of the cross-reactivity of each probe with the universal sequence.
     This process is performed once assuming that the probe is a CE, once assumed it is a LE. In this example, suppose we are looking for a cross-reaction of ce-amp with the designed probe
    </p>
    <p align="center"><b>NSH Score = x-mer values * weight factor = 1.375 * 6 =8.25</b></p>
    <p>2. The fraction of the x-mer is calculated to interact with the other probe NSH (which means that the x-mer algorithm also recalculates the cross-reactivity between the probes)。</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <p><b>The NSH response involves the interaction of the capture primer set and the marker extension primer set and the universal sequence leads to a high detection background in the bDNA assay.</b>.Minimizing the NSH response is an essential part of a successful primer set design. Therefore,
         Probedesigner is able to screen out primer probes to exclude those that may cause background elevation through NSH reactions. (Citing a literature on NSH responses,see M. Collins et. al., NAR Vol 25, no. 15, Aug 1997). </p>
        <p>Before you start, an important thing is how we define a "generic" sequence. These molecules, which are common in all BDNA detection systems (ie, the same general chemical type), mediate target capture and signal amplification 
        For the SYSTEM 1 detection system (open kit), they included branching DNA molecules, AP probes, and capture probes (PSCP) on the coated plate. For the SYSTEM 8 detection system, they included branching DNA molecules (with iso-C, iso-G), preloaded macromolecules and capture probes on the plate, CE
         The tail of the CE and LE primer sets (also extended) are also considered generic, and after splicing with specific extension sequences, they co-ordinate the possibility that the probes are hybridized to the universal sequence and subsequent signal amplification is possible. For any chemical system, these generic sequences are combined together to form a file into the ProbeDesigner software to become a group</p>
        <ul>
       Screening a probe from a probe set may result in a high background involving the following aspects:
         <Li> Identify a general extension that can lead to nonspecific hybridization; </li>
         <Li> Evaluate the hybrid stability that is formed between the universal and extended sequences; </li>
         <Li> Evaluate the impact of any potential stable cross reaction on the background. </Li>
        </ul>
        <p>对于NSH交叉反应System 1化学系统是这么描述的。 交叉反应的不同，取决于引物是作为CE引物还是LE引物。早期的设计过程中，我们没有指定引物的服务类型，任何引物都可以是CE引物或LE引物。 因此, 对于所有的引物组都是进行两次的分析，一种假设作为CE引物服务，一种假设作为LE引物服务。</p>
        <p>Probedesigner估计杂交稳定性及其背景影响。每一个相互作用的混合稳定性使用X-聚体算法评估（下面讨论），和混合背景的贡献乘以这个预测的加权因子的具体作用的稳定性计算。每个交互相关的系统1的共性评分如下。虽然建议使用默认设置，混合参数和NSH加权因素可以改变程序内使用NSH对话框。</p>    

<p>作为一个例子，注意ce-amp臂相互作用重15倍。如果混合的稳定性从X-聚体造方法是计算，说，“1”，这种相互作用的CE NSH的成绩是15分（的富润机械制造结果的15倍）。现在，如果你正在关注，你想知道为什么CE -“放大器- ARM”的互动给予更多的重量比行政长官“AMP领导人”和行政长官-“AP探针”的互动。为15x3分子，每个AMP武器有AP探针三结合位点。这将产生45个结合位点的AP和CE探针应该有非特异性配对。从概念上讲你可以想象为什么这是一个互动，我们希望避免NSH。 </p>
